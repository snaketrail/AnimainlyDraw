There are still some bugs but it's mostly usable.
The biggest bug right now is that if you add all images and try to move something, it moves to a random location on the canvas.

Subscribe and Shop buttons won't work right now, because I have to study payment APIs.

Feature I want it to have:
-Payment system;
-image storage like a database;
-more images to help with drawing.

PS: I'm too lazy to do the about page right now.
About page is commented because I'm not sure if I want to remove it.
